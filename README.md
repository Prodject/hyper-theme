# hyper-theme
Hyper theme for hyper terminal. 
I recommend you to install it alongside [hyperborder](https://github.com/webmatze/hyperborder) for best experience.

## Installation
If you have [hpm](https://github.com/zeit/hpm), simply use `hpm i hyper-theme`.

Otherwise, add it to plugins in config file `~/.hyper.js`:
```javascript
plugins: [
  "hyper-theme",
  "hyperborder" // install hyperborder for best experience
],
```
